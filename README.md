The program implements a sort of stack-and-register programming language for logical operations in JavaScript. The program is inspired by a stack machine problem that I had to solve for Launch School's JS foundations course. Some of the material below comes from Launch School.

A stack is a list of values that grows and shrinks. A stack-and-register programming language is a language that uses a stack of values. Each operation in the language operates on a register, which can be considered the current value. The register is not part of the stack. The register's value is initialized to `0`.

Programs are supplied to the language via a string. Each of the operations detailed below is self-contained (i.e., operations are not operands of one another) and the syntax of the string argument is that each operation is in uppercase and separated by one whitespace. An object (includes arrays) in the language must use JSON syntax.

## Register-only Operations ##

- 'X': Place any stringified JS value, 'X', into the register.
- 'PRINT': Prints the boolean version of the register value.
- 'NOT': Negates the register value.

All other operations also operate on the stack. The stack in mini-lang-3.js is unique in that it is initialized to include 4 arrays of length 0, which might be thought of as sub-stacks. The stack always includes these 4 sub-stacks. Before listing out the other operations of mini-lang-3.js, it is important to point out that objects (excluding arrays) are treated specially in the language. There are two primitive properties denoted by keys 'K' and 'N', respectively. The K property is either 'concrete' (exclusive) or 'nonconcrete' and the N property corresponds to the object's sub-stack number. The user cannot specify the N property, and if the user does not specify the K property, it will be determined by a random draw.

## PUSH and POP ##

- 'PUSH':
  - If a primitive value is pushed from the register, that value gets copied into every sub-stack.
  - If an array is pushed from the register, then 3 (shallow) copies of the array are made and all 4 arrays are placed into each sub-stack.
  - If an object (excludes arrays) is pushed from the register, then
    - first, it is ensured that the object has the two (shallow) primitive properties,
    - second, 3 (shallow) copies of the value are made,
    - third, for the 3 (shallow) copies the K property is determined by a random draw, and
    - fourth, all 4 arrays are placed into each sub-stack.

- 'POP':
  - If a primitive value is the topmost value of the topmost sub-stack, the value is removed from each of the sub-stacks and placed into the register.
  - If an object (includes arrays) is the topmost value of the topmost sub-stack,
    - the value is placed into the register, and
    - the value _and_ all of its counterparts are removed from each of the sub-stacks.
  - If the topmost item of the topmost sub-stack is empty, `undefined` is placed into the register (i.e., it is possible to work with stacks of length 0).

## Logical Operations for Topmost Item in the Topmost Sub-Stack ##

- 'AND':


AND: Pop a value off of the stack and check conjunction of Boolean(value) and Boolean(register), storing result in register.
OR: Pop a value off of the stack and check disjunction of Boolean(value) and Boolean(register), storing result in register
CON: Pop a value off of the stack and check disjunction of !Boolean(value) and Boolean(register), storing result in register
BCON: Pop a value off of the stack and check Boolean(value) ? Boolean(register) : !Boolean(register)

ID: Pop a value off of the stack and check value === register, storing result in register
TRU: Pop a value off of the stack and check Boolean(value) === true, storing result in register
OBJECT-EXISTS: Pop a value off of the stack and check whether it is an object with properties, storing result in register
OBJECT-CONCRETE: Pop a value off of the stack and check whether it is an object with the concreteness property, storing result in register
PRIM-EXISTS: Pop a value off of the stack and check whether it is a primitive value other than NaN.

## Logical Operations Across All Sub-Stacks ##




















This might sound complex, but the behavior is straightforward. Consider an OR operation in a stack-and-register language. It removes the topmost value from the stack, determines whether either the stack value or the register value is true, and stores the result back in the register. For example, if we start with a stack [3, true, 0 (where 0 is the topmost element in the stack) and a register value of [], the OR operation selects the 0 from the stack, and the result of the operation, true (after Boolean coercion), is left in the register. If we do another OR at this point, the true is selected from the stack, and the register is left with the value of true.

Consider an ID operation in the language. It removes the topmost value from the stack, determines whether the stack value and the register value are identical, and stores the result back in the register. For example, if we start with a stack [3, true, [3]] and register value of [3], the ID operation selects the [3] from the stack, and the result of the operation, false, is left in the register. If we do another ID at this point, the true is selected from the stack, and the register is left with the value of false. Finally, consider an EVERY-ID operation in the language. It determines whether each stack value and the register value are identical, and stores the result back in the register. For example, if we start with a stack [3, '3', [3]] and register value of [3], the result of the EVERY-ID operation, false, is left in the register.
